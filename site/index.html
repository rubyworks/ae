    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
    AE is an assertions framework designed to serve as a reusable domain language
    for other test frameworks. It is light-weight, easy to use and versatile. The
    DSL is entirely focused around two methods #assert and #expect.</p>

    <h1>Features</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Clear, simple and concise syntax.</li>
      <li>Uses higher-order functions and fluid notation.</li>
      <li>Easily extensible allowing for alternate notations.</li>
      <li>Reusable core extensions ease assertion construction.</li>
      <li>Core extensions are standardized around Ruby Facets.</li>
      <li>Facets is not a dependency; the extensions are built-in.</li>
      <li>Eats it's own dog food.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Adaptations</h1>
    <p>AE is the standard assertions framework for QED and Lemon; works with
    Test::Unit, MiniTest and Shoulda; and is easily adapted to almost any
    other testing framework.</p>

    <!-- <p>Put on the Red Boxing Gloves!</p> -->

    <!--
    <p>The heart of AE is the Assertion class, a subclass
    of Exception. By raising an Assertion, an assertion failure is recorded.
    Around this call, AE defines a versitle and highly readible standard DSL,
    and provides a set of useful optional DSLs.</p>

    <p>The primary method of which is #assert (or #should if the `subjunctive`
    library is loaded). This method is fully compatible with the same method from
    TestUnit, but adds the ability to act as an assertion <i>functor</i>.

<p>AE is an assertions framework designed to serve as a reusable domain language
for other test frameworks. It is light-weight, easy to use and highly versitle.</p>

, such as <a href="http://proutils.github.com/qed">QED</a> and
<a href="http://cukes.info">Cucumber</a>.

Essentially AE defines the method <code>assert</code>. The method is compatible
with the same method as defined by Test::Unit and minitest which verifies truth
of a single argument (and can accept an optional failure message).</p>

  <pre>
  assert( true )
  </pre>

<p>In addition AE's <code>assert</code> method has been extended to accept a
block, the result of which is likewise verified.</p>

  <pre>
  assert{ true }
  </pre>

<p>But the real power the AE's <code>assert</code> method lies in it's use
without an argument or a block. In that case it returns an instance of
<code>Assertor</code>. An <code>Assertor</code> is an <i>Assertions Functor</i>,
or  <i>Higher-Order Function</i> --a function that operates on another function.
With it, we easily make assertions with a fluent notation.</p>

  <pre>
  x.assert == y

  a.assert.include? e

  StandardError.assert.raised? do
    ...
  end
  </pre>

<p>And so forth. Any method can be used in conjunction with <code>assert</code>
to make an assertion.</p>

  <pre>
  class String
    def daffy?
      /daffy/i =~ self
    end
  end

  "Daffy Duck".assert.daffy?
  </pre>

<p>In addition to <code>assert</code>, AE provides two optional nomenclatures,
<code>expect</code> and <code>should</code> (or <code>must</code>).</p>
